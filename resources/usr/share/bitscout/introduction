<PROJECTCAPNAME> system
<PROJECTCAPNAME> is the project initially created by Vitaly Kamluk
for remote triage and forensic analysis of compromised systems.
It is based on idea of transparent and managed remote 
forensic analysis which maintains trust relationship with 
the owner of the system. Based on live booting system it 
constructs a virtual container with child operating system 
and virtualizes super-user privileges. It automatically 
connects to the pre-defined VPN server and allows incoming
SSH connections over VPN link directly to the container.

You can use this simple tool to do some of standard 
operations and let the remote forensic expert work on
locally attached evidence disks. 

Here is what you need for that:
 1. Connect current system to the internet.
    Note: DHCP/static IP is supported
          LAN/WiFi is supported
          HTTP/SOCKS proxy is supported
          IPv6 is NOT supported
 2. Talk to the remote expert, confirm access to the
    container.

 3. Map physical disks (or partitions) to virtual devices
    in the container.
    Note: the disks are mapped in read-only mode.

Once the session started you can monitor the progress and
chat with the expert.

Note: All changes will be made only to RAM or USB drives
attached and authorized for writing. If the system reboots 
or power is off the process has to be restarted unless
saved to persistence storage (remote disk or locally
attached USB flash drive).

Good luck!
